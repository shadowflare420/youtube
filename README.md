various things in direct relation to my channel or its videos.

regarding re-use:
i have not added a liscense to this because of unfamiliarity with such things and the difficulty in making adjustments to it when needed. everything i make myself inside or outside this repo should be considered open, however you reuse stuff at your own risk as i am a fucking moron trying to do smart things and likely make big mistakes in everything without noticing. check to make sure things are safe to use yourself instead of just copy-pasting and hoping everything's fine.

in short you can use everything here however you like so long as it does not cause direct harm to me or my channel.

examples:
you can repost any of my videos anywhere you like, with or without modification, even claiming them as your own. thats fair in my opinion, in fact i encourage it. however i would appreciate you crediting my channel for the sauce.

if you repost one of my videos as your own and claim copyright against my channel either giving me a channel strike or taking monetization from my videos that would not be ok and i will spend the rest of my days trying to take you down in retaliation if you don't immediately reverse it. or however many days it takes me to get bored.

you can re-use my code however you like. make a missile controlled in part by my spaghetti see if i care, but i'm not responsible when it goes sideways and kills the neighbor's dog or is used to massacre unsuspecting orphans.
