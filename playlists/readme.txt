readme updated 3/4/2025 (M/D/YYYY)

this folder contains files with links to youtube playlists.
the reason for this existing is that i intend to post many, many playlists of many, many different replay/redos, and as such using youtube's interface for finding them would be a nightmare.

basic usage info:
  each game will get its own text file without an extension, i.e. "skyrim"
  each non-game playlist will be sorted by catagory, not sure on the specifics yet.
  each text file will have a brief (single line) description of each playlist before each link
  a additional file named "all" will have all the links for every playlist seperated by the filename for the playlist sorting described above, dunno how it might be used however its there and might help with creating a archive idk.
